Download GitHub app for Windows / Mac 
(You don't need to learn the command line stuff)

Using GitHub you have to link your local (your computer) with the remote (online) code

You must clone the remote to your local machine (if you haven't done it already)
https://github.com/FiveGuys/CMS -> Clone on Desktop (this will open the app and set up for you)

* In the app there is a branches tab don't worry about that *

If you have the code on your local machine but want to get the latest version from remote
Use Sync

If you add / change code in your local and want to commit use the Changes tab
Using commit, commits to your local and when your done with all your changes commit and sync everything.
